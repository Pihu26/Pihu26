### üíª **Blockchain Engineer | Smart Contract Developer | Web3 Enthusiast**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I‚Äôm passionate about building decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts that push the boundaries of blockchain technology. With a focus on creating secure, scalable solutions in the Web3 space, my experience spans across various blockchain platforms, including Ethereum, Solana, and Tron.

## üåü **Summary**
I specialize in designing and deploying smart contracts for NFTs, ERC20 tokens, and decentralized lotteries. My expertise lies in:
- Developing decentralized applications using Solidity, Hardhat, and OpenZeppelin.
- Indexing blockchain data with The Graph and leveraging IPFS for decentralized storage.
- Crafting efficient smart contracts with a focus on security and performance, tested on Ethereum testnets.

As a continuous learner, I thrive on innovation and delivering real-world solutions in the blockchain space.
